This project focuses on predicting the burned area in Thailand during March 2024 using Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) fire detection sensors from three different satellites: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-20 (NOAA-20), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-21 (NOAA-21), and Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP or Suomi). The analysis investigates the relationships between burned area, Fire Radiative Power (FRP), and dominant crop types, with the goal of assessing how these factors improve model predictions and comparing the performance of the three satellites.

## Delivering your Project

Your final project is delivered in two components: a report and your code.

### Report

Your report should be **delivered via your website**. Submit a link to your website on BruinLearn so that your instructor can browse it to find your report. 

To make this simple, you can write the report using a word processor or Latex, then export it as a .pdf file and upload it to the `assets` directory. You can then link to it [like so](/assets/project_demo.pdf). However, you can also type the report directly onto the website using another markdown page - [here is](/project.md) a template for that.

### Code

A link to your code must be submitted on BruinLearn, and the course instructor must be able to download your code to mark it. The code could be in a Google Colab notebook (make sure to *share* the notebook so access is set to **Anyone with the link**), or you could upload the code into a separate GitHub repository, or you could upload the code into the `assets` directory of your website and link to it.
