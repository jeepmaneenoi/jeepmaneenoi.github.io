This project focuses on predicting the burned area in Thailand during March 2024 using Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) fire detection sensors from three different satellites: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-20 (NOAA-20), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-21 (NOAA-21), and Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP or Suomi). The analysis investigates the relationships between burned area, Fire Radiative Power (FRP), and dominant crop types, with the goal of assessing how these factors improve model predictions and comparing the performance of the three satellites.
